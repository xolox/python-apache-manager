"""
A ``top`` like interactive viewer for Apache web server metrics.

The :mod:`~apache_manager.interactive` module implements a ``top`` like
interactive viewer for Apache web server metrics using curses_. It can be
invoked from the command line using ``apache-manager --watch``.

Please note that the functions in this module are not included in the test
suite and are excluded from coverage calculations because:

1. For now this module is just an interesting experiment. It might disappear
   completely or I might change it significantly, it all depends on time and
   interest. For example it would be cool to have a tool like mytop_ or
   innotop_ for Apache workers, but it's going to take time to build something
   like that and I have 40+ open source projects and limited spare time, so I'm
   not going to commit to anything :-).

2. This is my first time working with Python's :mod:`curses` module (and
   curses_ interfaces in general) and it's not yet clear to me how feasible it
   is to test an interactive command line interface that's not line based.
